## What this is

The compose window today is a textarea + Oliver preview: the author edits
markup and *reads* rendered output. This spike adds visual editing — typing
into the rendered surface — for **one node type** (the plain single-line
paragraph) and pins the **markup op contract** every further node type
reuses. It is a spike, not the finished editor: the contract and the
boundaries are the deliverable, the paragraph proves them end to end.

## Locked rules (do not reopen)

1. **No parallel document model.** The DOM inside the visual surface is
   *ephemeral paint*, exactly like the highlighter's colored attributes.
   `ComposeDocument.text` stays the single source of truth.
2. **Oliver stays the only renderer.** The visual surface loads Oliver's
   fragment through the same sandboxed-WKWebView document assembly as the
   preview pane (#230). Nothing in Swift parses markup semantics.
3. **Visual edits are markup ops.** A DOM edit event is translated into a
   pure buffer splice — the same posture as the #263 formatting verbs,
   which are marker transforms derived from Oliver's documented surface,
   never a grammar.
4. **The block map is a conservative sniff, never a parse.** Line shape
   and marker prefixes classify blocks, mirroring `ComposeHighlighter`'s
   documented posture. When classification is uncertain the block is
   non-editable; when source/rendered alignment cannot be *verified*, the
   visual surface disables itself and falls back to the plain preview.
5. **Never guess silently.** Unmappable DOM edits are discarded at the next
   reconcile (the buffer is truth); the DOM is never treated as authority.

## The op contract

### Visual edit event (JS → host)

The contenteditable surface emits one JSON message per `beforeinput`
(WebKit, `contenteditable="plaintext-only"` so paste and typing are plain
text by construction):

```json
{ "blockIndex": 3, "inputType": "insertText",
  "start": 12, "end": 12, "data": "e" }
```

- `blockIndex` — index among the rendered document's block-level children
  (marked `data-block` by the host after load; the host owns the numbering).
- `start`/`end` — UTF-16 code-unit offsets **within the block's rendered
  text**. For editable blocks (below) rendered text equals the block's
  source line text verbatim, so the offsets are buffer-relative after the
  block-map translation. Collapsed range = caret.
- `data` — the text the input inserts, if any.
- The event is *not* `preventDefault()`-ed: the browser applies its own
  mutation and keeps the caret; the host mirrors the same edit into the
  buffer. Drift between the two is corrected at reconcile (below).

Swift mirror: `ComposeVisualEditEvent` (`Decodable`, pure value).

### Markup ops (host-side, pure)

`ComposeMarkupOp` is the closed set of buffer mutations visual editing may
produce. Every op is a value; application is a pure function:

```swift
enum ComposeMarkupOp: Equatable {
    case insertText(String, at: Int)   // UTF-16 buffer offset
    case replaceText(NSRange, String)  // selection replace / paste / IME commit
    case deleteText(NSRange)           // backspace, forward-delete, cut
}
```

- **Derivation** — `ComposeMarkupOp.derive(from:in:blockMap:)` maps a
  visual event onto an op or returns `nil` (unmappable):
  - `insertText` (with `data`) → insert at caret or replace the extent.
    A nil `data` is unmappable — never guess an empty splice.
  - **Deliberately unmapped in the spike:** `insertFromPaste` (WebKit
    carries the payload on `dataTransfer`, never `data`; reading the
    clipboard needs an async hop the op contract does not have),
    `insertCompositionText` (mid-IME half-composed text must never
    splice), `insertReplacementText`, and `insertTranspose` (spelling-
    autoswap semantics we do not model). Each returns `nil` host-side,
    and the bridge `preventDefault()`s the DOM side of the same set so
    paint never desyncs from the buffer. The buffer stays untouched and
    the next reconcile snaps the DOM back to truth. Paste support is a
    follow-up card (bridge reads `dataTransfer`, forwards the string as
    `data`).
  - `deleteContentBackward` / `deleteContentForward` / `deleteByCut` /
    `deleteByDrag` with an extent → delete the extent; collapsed → delete
    one grapheme before/after the caret (surrogate-pair and ZWJ aware —
    never split one).
  - Paragraph breaks (`insertParagraphBreak`, `insertLineBreak`) are
    **unmappable in the spike** (a visual paragraph split is a block-level
    restructure, follow-up card); Enter is also intercepted in JS so the
    DOM never produces one.
  - Anything unrecognized → `nil`.
- **Application** — `applied(to:)` returns the new buffer and the
  resulting caret offset (UTF-16). The caret is remembered for
  reconcile-time restoration; the buffer splice flows through
  `ComposeDocument.text.didSet` so dirty state, word count, and language
  detection behave exactly as if the author typed in the textarea.
- **Marker verbs** (bold, headings, links…) are *designed into* the
  contract as the existing `ComposeFormat` transforms — a visual Cmd-B is
  `ComposeFormat.apply(.bold, …)` at the block-map-translated range. The
  spike ships paragraph text only; marker verbs are the second node-type
  card and add no new contract surface.
- **Undo** — spike limitation, owned: the DOM keeps its own undo stack and
  the buffer splices do not yet register on a shared one. The contract
  requires ops to be values *so that* a shared undo stack can replay them
  later; that integration is a follow-up.

### The block map

`ComposeBlockMap.compute(source:frontmatterStripped:)` splits the buffer
into block records by line shape — the same prefixes the highlighter
paints:

| Source shape | Kind | Rendered as | Editable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| doc-start `---`/`+++` … closing fence | `frontmatter` | stripped (policy ≠ none) or passthrough | no |
| `#{1,6} ` line | `heading` | one `hN` | no (spike) |
| maximal run of plain non-blank lines | `paragraph` | one `p` (or soft-break joined) | **yes iff single line and marker-free** |
| maximal run of list-marker lines (`- `/`* `/`+ `/`N. `/`N) `) | `list` | one `ul`/`ol` | no (spike) |
| maximal run of `>` lines | `quote` | one `blockquote` | no (spike) |
| fenced ``` run | `fence` | one `pre` | no |
| indented (tab/4-space) run | `code` | one `pre><code` | no |
| `---`/`***`/`===` line | `rule`/`setext` | `hr` / joins heading above | no |
| anything else | `opaque` | whatever Oliver emits | no |

**Editable-paragraph predicate** (all must hold): the block is exactly one
line; the line contains none of `` * _ ` ~ [ ] < > & \ { `` (any inline
marker possibility); the render options are text-preserving (smartypants,
wikilinks, and every extension that rewrites characters or block structure
are off — the defaults). This is deliberately over-strict: a paragraph
with an asterisk is simply not visual-editable yet.

**Alignment is verified, not assumed.** After Oliver renders, the host
counts the DOM's block-level children and compares against the map's
rendered-block count (frontmatter policy shifts the count; the map knows).
On any mismatch the visual surface shows the plain preview and a one-line
notice instead of editing. Misclassified shapes (setext headings, loose
lists) degrade here — visible, honest, never corrupting.

## The spike surface

A **Visual** toolbar toggle (Markdown buffers only) switches the preview
pane into visual mode:

- `ComposeVisualDocument.html(fragment:themeCSS:)` — the #230 document
  assembly plus the visual script: `data-block` numbering, per-block
  `contenteditable="plaintext-only"` for the editable index set, the
  `beforeinput` → message bridge, Enter interception, and
  caret/scroll-restore entry points.
- `ComposeVisualEditorView` + coordinator — hosts the WKWebView
  (non-persistent store, single-load navigation policy reused from
  `ComposePreviewSandbox`), receives the message-handler events, derives
  ops, splices the buffer.
- **Reconcile policy** — the visual pane does not live-reload per
  keystroke. It re-renders through Oliver after 1.5 s of edit silence or
  on blur, then restores the caret (from the last op's result offset,
  re-mapped through the fresh block map) and scroll position. Between
  reconciles the DOM's own state is provisional; the buffer is truth, so
  a reconcile discards exactly the edits that failed to map.
- Save, dirty state, status bar, find bar, and the textarea pane are
  unchanged — they all read the same buffer.

## Boundaries & fallbacks

- Cooklang/Textile buffers: no visual toggle (Markdown spike only).
- Render options that transform text (smartypants, wikilinks, …): visual
  mode stays available but with an empty editable set (read-only surface)
  until the options are back to text-preserving.
- Frontmatter present + policy `none`: editable set empty (the passthrough
  render shape is not stable to map).
- Any message the host cannot map: no-op on the buffer; next reconcile
  snaps the DOM back to truth.
- The visual pane never navigates (same sandbox as #230) and never gains
  network/file access (`loadHTMLString`, `baseURL: nil`).

## Follow-ups (not in this spike)

1. Marker verbs in visual mode (Cmd-B/I/K) via `ComposeFormat` at mapped
   ranges — second node-type card.
2. Headings and lists as editable blocks (prefix-aware text ranges).
3. Visual paragraph splitting (Enter) — needs a block-level op kind
   (`splitBlock`), contract extension.
4. Shared undo stack replaying ops across both surfaces.
5. boris-editor upstream: the same op contract expressed over its
   SourcePane (filed as an issue draft there, never a PR to boris).

## Test posture

- `ComposeBlockMapTests` — classification, editable predicate, frontmatter
  policy alignment, alignment-failure detection.
- `ComposeMarkupOpTests` — event → op derivation (insert, replace,
  surrogate-pair deletes, unmappables), application + caret results.
- `ComposeVisualDocumentTests` — document assembly: script present,
  `</style>` guard inherited, editable gating by index set.
- `ComposeVisualEditorE2ETests` — one real-WKWebView round trip (same
  pattern as #230's tests): synthetic `beforeinput` on an editable block
  → message → op → buffer contains the edit.
